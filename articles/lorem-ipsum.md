# The Luck of the Fryrish

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. Really?! You guys go on without me! I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal! Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

## A Head in the Polls

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. Now what?

- Well, then good news! It's a suppository.
- Fry, we have a crate to deliver.
- Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.
- Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

### Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?
